Xenon is a general system for performing design space explorations (DSEs). The
output of Xenon is a set of configurations, each of which is *input* for
another tool designed to model the problem at hand. In this tutorial, we will
illustrate Xenon's capabilities with the use case of designing a simple desk.

There are three primary steps for building a design sweep with Xenon:

1. [Define a data model](tutorial-datamodel.md)
2. [Instantiate the data model](tutorial-datamodel.md)
3. [Write a Xenon sweep script](tutorial-sweepscript.md)
